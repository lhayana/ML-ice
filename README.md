# ML-ice
Projects of the Machine Learning undergraduate class from ICE/UFRN, taught by teachers Diego Laplagne and Daniel Takahashi.

1. **Image manipulation and processing using Numpy:** In this lesson, I had to turn png files into numpy arrays and manipulate them, cutting and changing their colors. In the end, I used the OpenCV library to turn all the images into a single video.
